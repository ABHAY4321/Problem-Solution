Problem:
Why the entire directory visible in terminal because it takes too much space?

Solution: 
Since bash 4, to shorten the depth of directory in command-line is done by using PROMPT_DIRTRIM in the .bashrc file. Just remember to reopen your terminal or source .bashrc file.

PROMPT_DIRTRIM=1
source ~/.bashrc
