==> If we setup fresh Ubuntu desktop machine in VMWare, we won't be able to copy-paste between host & gusest OS. Also if we exit from full screen, it won't auto adjust the screen as per the new screen size. To solve these, follow the steps below-
1. Open the Terminal
2. Update Package Information
# sudo apt-get update
3. Install VMware Tools on GUI-Based Ubuntu
# sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop
4. Install VMware Tools on Terminal-Based Ubuntu
# sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools
5. Reboot the Machine
# sudo reboot
==> Now we will be done with resolving above issues.
